**Object storage** is data storage architecture that manages data as objects.
* S3 provides an unlimited storage
* It is severless

**S3 Object:** Objects contain data (they are like files)
Object may consist of:
* *Key* : this is the name of the Object or(prefix + object name)
* *Vlaue* : the data itself made up of sequence of bytes
* *Version ID* : When versioning is enabled
* *Metadata* : additional information attached to the object
* Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
Object size can be from **0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes**, If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”

**S3 Bucket** : holds objects and folders. 
* Bucket names are universal, they must be unique

## Amazon S3 – Security
- User-Based 
	- IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM 
- Resource-Based 
	- Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account 
	- Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled) 
	- Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled)

## Versioning
- if an object is updated the old version still persists within the bucket
- if an object is deleted the new version will be a delete marker, and the old version will still persist within the bucket

## Replication
- must have versioning in both buckets
- can be cross region or same region
- can be bucket in other account
- async
- use batch replication to replicate existing ones
- cant chain replication

## S3 Storage Classes 
- Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose 
- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA) (For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed)
- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access 
- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval (Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup)
	- Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
- Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval 
	- • Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) – free
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive 
	- • Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours)
- Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering (Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage)
Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations

## Lifecycle Rules
- Transition Actions – configure objects to transition to another storage class 
	- Move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after creation 
	- Move to Glacier for archiving after 6 months 
- Expiration actions – configure objects to expire (delete) after some time 
	- Access log files can be set to delete after a 365 days 
	- Can be used to delete old versions of files (if versioning is enabled) 
	- Can be used to delete incomplete Multi-Part uploads

## S3 Analytics – Storage Class Analysis
Help you decide when to transition objects to the right storage class
Good first step to put together Lifecycle Rules (or improve them)!
## S3 event notifications#
targets : sqs. sns. lambda 
can also use event bridge for more targets and filters

## Performance
- 100-200ms latency
- 3,5k put copy post delte per prefix
- 5,5k read per prefix
- use multi part upload for parallell upload, recommended for files > 100MB, must use for files > 5GB
- transfer acceleration to upload to edge location instead of directly to s3, also use for dl if files are bigger than 1GB, • **Compatible with multi-part upload**
- byte range fetches -> multi part download, Can be used to retrieve only partial data (for example the head of a file)

## Batch operations
- modify all metadata and properties
- copy objects between buckets
- encrypt all unencrypted objects
- modify acl and tags
- restore objects from glacier
- invoke lambda for each object
- use s3 select to filter then batch

## S3 – Storage Lens
- Understand, analyze, and optimize storage across entire AWS Organization
- Discover anomalies, identify cost efficiencies, and apply data protection best practices across entire AWS Organization (30 days usage & activity metrics) 
- Aggregate data for Organization, specific accounts, regions, buckets, or prefixes

## Encryption

### Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
- Server Side encryption of objects 
- aws managed
- replication by default

### Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
- Server Side encryption
- customer managed keys
- objects can not be replicated
- from CLI

### Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)
- Need to specify need key for object in new bucket
- need iam role to decrypt with source key and encrypt with new key
- might get [[KMS]] throttling errors, need to ask for service quotas increase
- can use multi region kms keys 

### Client Side Encryption
- Encrypt before upload and decrypt after download using own mechanism

### Amazon S3 – Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
Amazon S3 exposes two endpoints: • HTTP Endpoint – non encrypted • HTTPS Endpoint – encryption in flight
Amazon S3 Force Encryption in Transit aws:SecureTransport


• **Note**: Bucket Policies are evaluated before “Default Encryption”

## Amazon S3 – MFA Delete

To use MFA Delete, Versioning must be enabled on the bucket 
Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA Delete
MFA will be required to: • Permanently delete an object version • Suspend Versioning on the bucket

## S3 Access Logs
For audit purpose, you may want to log all access to S3 buckets
• The target logging bucket must be in the same AWS region

## Pre-Signed URLs
give temporary access to the files in the bucket via url with already signed credentials
• Examples: 
- Allow only logged-in users to download a premium video from your S3 bucket 
- Allow an ever-changing list of users to download files by generating URLs dynamically 
- Allow temporarily a user to upload a file to a precise location in your S3 bucket

## Vault
- Objects can not be modified or deleted
- used for compliance
- Can lock the vault policy from future edits
## S3 Object Lock (versioning must be enabled)
- **Retention mode - Compliance:** 
	- Object versions can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user 
	- Objects retention modes can't be changed, and retention periods can't be shortened
- **Retention mode - Governance: 
	- Most users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings 
	- Some users have special permissions to change the retention or delete the object •
- **Retention Period:** 
	- protect the object for a fixed period, it can be extended 
- **Legal Hold:** • protect the object indefinitely, independent from retention period • can be freely placed and removed using the s3:PutObjectLegalHold IAM permission![[Screenshot 2025-03-05 123150.png]]
